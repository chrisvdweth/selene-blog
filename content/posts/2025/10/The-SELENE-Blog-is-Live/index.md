## Welcome to Selene!!! Yay 


The goal of SELENE is to be an open platform for self-paced learning and self-assessment, with a focus on but not limited to AI and related topics. Simply speaking, SELENE can be seen as a large-scale virtual textbook, going beyond the limitations of classic textbooks in the following ways:

* Unlimited scope w.r.t. to the topics covered (at least in principle)
* Support and emphasis on hands-on learning ("Learning by Doing") through interactive topic materials
* Easy linking between related and dependent topics to guide the learning process and provide mastery paths


### Components

The SELENE learning platform consists of two core components:

* **Jupyter notebook repository** (here on Github): Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source, interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They allow for a hands-on learning experience through modifying and running code examples. The repository will be a comprehensive and well-structured set of such notebooks organized into meaningful topics, projects, and applications. 
* **Interactive web interface:** The web interface will allow users to visualize, navigate, and search for topics. It will also be able to recommend and visualize mastery paths for self-paced learning and provide knowledge checks for self-assessment. The web interface is currently under active development and will soon be available as a first prototype for testing. As a teaser, here are two early screenshots of the SELENE web interface:
