Well, this is it. Our *"Hello, World!"* post. We created this blog as part of the SELENE platform that we are building right now.


### What is SELENE?

The goal of SELENE is to be an open platform for self-paced learning and self-assessment. SELENE can be seen as a large-scale virtual textbook, providing detailed and illustrative content but also emphasising hands-on learning (*"Learning by Doing"*) through interactive materials. To this end, the SELENE learning platform consists of two core components:
* [Public Jupyter notebook repository](https://github.com/chrisvdweth/selene): Jupyter Notebooks are an open-source, interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. They allow for a hands-on learning experience through modifying and running code examples. The repository will be a comprehensive and well-structured set of such notebooks organized into meaningful topics, projects, and applications.
* [Interactive online portal](https://chrisvdw.net/projects/selene/) (current demo prototype only!): The online portal will allow you to visualize, navigate, and search for topics. It will also be able to recommend and visualize mastery paths for self-paced learning and provide knowledge checks for self-assessment. The portal is currently under active development and will soon be available as a first live prototype for testing

You can check out the [repository](https://github.com/chrisvdweth/selene) right to see if we already have a topic that might interest you. We started with topics covering fundamentals in AI, machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing. But SELENE is constantly growing!



### Why this blog?

The purpose of this blog is to go beyond just the learning content we want to provide with the notebook repository and the online portal. Technology has always &mdash; and with the explosion of AI even more so &mdash; individuals, groups, and whole societies. On this blog, we therefore want to cover the latest news and trends (in research and industry), discuss the impact of technology on society, share personal opinions, as well as simply keep you up to date with everything that's going on with SELENE. 

Many posts are meant to spark thought, raise questions, and invite discussion. Our goal is that you walk away not only with something new to consider, but also with the curiosity to keep digging deeper on your own. This is also new territory for us, so let's see where this is going.


### Who is it for?

SELENE and this blog is for anyone who is interested in the topics of AI, machine learning, data mining, data science, and so on. However, we also share our content with teachers and educators as a source for teaching materials. Ultimately, this blog is more than just a collection of articles &mdash; it is an invitation to join a community of learners who believe that curiosity and persistence are the best teachers. Whether you are here to pick up a new skill, gain deeper understanding, or find inspiration for your own projects, you are in the right place.
