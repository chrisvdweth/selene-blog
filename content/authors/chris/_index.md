I'm a Senior Lecturer in the School of Computing at the National University of Singapore. I received my MSc from the Ilmenau University of Technology and PhD from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. Before joining NUS, I worked as a Research Fellow at the Nanyang Technological University in Singapore and the National University of Ireland, Galway. Prior to being a Lecturer, I was Senior Research Fellow at the NUS Centre for Research in Privacy Technologies (N-CRiPT) in SoC.
