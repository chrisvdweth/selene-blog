I'm a Lecturer at the School of Computing, NUS, Singapore. Prior to this, I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow working with Prof. Mohan S Kankanhalli in the N-CRiPT lab. My current research is focused on social network analysis. I obtained my PhD from the Computer Science Department at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, under the guidance of Prof. Sayan Ranu in the AIDB Lab, IIT-M. My thesis is focused on searching and optimization on graphs. Before joining IIT-M, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the Computer Science and Automation Department at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, India, where I worked with Prof. Ambedkar Dukkipati in the area of Information Theory.
